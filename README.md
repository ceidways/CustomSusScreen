# CustomSusScreen
Scuffed edit of CustomSplashScreen. Changes minecraft's splash screen to <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/amogus/comments/zyy9jb/when_mojang_is_sus_oc_too_big_of_a_coincidence/">a certain animation</a>.

Can change to a static image, disable load bar or change load bar colours.

Replacing the animation files in the config folder will work, but I manually adjusted the animation speed with variables in the code, so not sure how well it will display.
If you wish to attempt to make sense of my code to make an easily customizable animation, good luck.

Cannot revert to vanilla splash screen in config. Deliberate to troll the people I send this to.
