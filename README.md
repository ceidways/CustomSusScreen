# CustomSusScreen
Scuffed edit of CustomSplashScreen. Changes minecraft's splash screen to <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/amogus/comments/zyy9jb/when_mojang_is_sus_oc_too_big_of_a_coincidence/">a certain animation</a>.

Can change to static image, disable load bar or change load bar colours.

If you want to change to your own animation, replace the png files in the config folder. 

Tweak AnimSpeed and FramesAhead in config to get it looking right. Enabling LoadUnusedFrames will mean that you don't have to restart every time you change AnimSpeed, disabled by default due to increased minecraft startup time.

Cannot revert to vanilla splash screen in config. Deliberate to troll the people I send this to.
